I made this Python OS by watching tutorials from Cyber coding. Link to his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYLG90eYy6OxeINDgsAnDhw .

ZamarakamOS v1.0
The following are the required dependencies:
python 3.8
psutil
PyQtWebEngine
PyQt5
TK

This OS is NOT concerned with security and instead is just a fun litle OS to play around with.
